I am passionate about clinical trials, evidence synthesis, and advancing healthcare through rigorous research.  
With a background in veterinary medicine and public health, I bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to my work in pharmacoepidemiology and infectious disease research.

Currently, I am also part of the Certificate Program in Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, and my research focuses include oncology, healthcare-associated infections, and digital health interventions to improve patient care.
